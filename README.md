Bugs Fixed
(i) The interface should ask for account number while depositing money. Earlier it was adding to the current pointer.
(ii) The interface should ask the account number while approving loan. Earlier it was considering only the current pointer.
(iii) Shouldn't stop after throwing error in case the account number is invalid.

Features Added
(i) Now in case the loan is denied, the customer can know the amount with which the loan is denied.
(ii) In case of denial of loan, the customer also gets to know the maximum amount of loan that can be approved to him/her.
(iii) While selecting the account i.e. (2) from the menu, now it shows whether the account is savings or checking or interestchecking.
(iv) As an exercise question mentioned in the PDF, also added the Mony Market Account with 20 percent interest rate and loan approval if one-third of the money is present in the account.
(v) Bank can get to know the amount they have at the current moment.

Future Scope 
(i) Bank can know the amount they have for now, and this can be helpful in the approval of loan. The loan can only be approved if it is less than half of the current money bank have.
(ii) Shouldn't throw error upon invalid command.
(iii) Use of stream API in selecting the maximum balance, etc.
